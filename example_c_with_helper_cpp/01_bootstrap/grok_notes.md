What Happened in Detail?
1. Original main.c Worked
Your original main.c (submitted first) successfully initialized Vulkan and SDL3, rendered a triangle and cube, and handled camera controls. It used a minimal, hardcoded setup for Vulkan extensions (VK_KHR_SURFACE_EXTENSION_NAME and VK_KHR_win32_surface) and a single queue for both graphics and presentation. This simplicity avoided potential runtime errors related to Vulkan configuration.

2. My Modified main.c Failed
Why It Failed: My version introduced changes that likely caused a runtime failure, leading to the window closing immediately:
Dynamic Extensions: I replaced the hardcoded extensions with SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions, which dynamically retrieves extensions. If SDL3 returned unexpected or incompatible extensions (e.g., missing VK_KHR_win32_surface or adding extras your Vulkan driver didn’t support), vkCreateInstance could fail, triggering an exit(1).

Dual Queues: I added a separate presentQueue, requiring proper queue family selection for presentation. If the selected graphicsFamily didn’t support presentation (or if the swapchain wasn’t configured correctly for sharing), vkQueuePresentKHR would fail, again triggering an exit(1).

Shader Loading: Both versions load vert.spv and frag.spv from the current directory. If the post-build copy worked (as it did in your last build), this wasn’t the issue, but any subtle path mismatch could cause an fopen failure.

Symptoms: The immediate window closure suggests one of these fprintf(stderr, ...); exit(1); lines was hit during initialization, likely in init_vulkan() or create_pipeline().

3. Fixed Version Works
Reverted to Original Logic: The fixed main.c I provided last reverted to your original Vulkan initialization:
Hardcoded extensions ensured compatibility with your Vulkan driver.

Single graphicsQueue simplified the setup, assuming it supports both graphics and presentation (common on most hardware).

** Kept Build Compatibility**: Retained SDL3 event handling (event.key.key, SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode) and timing (SDL_GetTicks) as per your preferences, ensuring it matched your working build environment.

Result: The program now initializes Vulkan, creates a pipeline, and enters the main loop without hitting an early exit, matching the behavior of your original code.


Why Pure C Wasn’t Fully an Option
You’re correct that achieving a pure C solution isn’t straightforward with your current dependencies, and here’s why:
vk-bootstrap is C++:
vk-bootstrap (https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap) is written in C++ and relies on C++ features (e.g., classes, templates) to simplify Vulkan initialization. While it exposes a C-compatible header (VkBootstrap.h), its implementation requires a C++ compiler, making it impossible to stay pure C when using it.

Other Libraries:
SDL3: Pure C, no issues here.

cglm: Pure C, a lightweight math library, fully compatible with a pure C goal.

Vulkan API: Pure C (via vulkan.h), but its manual setup is verbose and error-prone without a helper library like vk-bootstrap.

Trade-off:
To stay pure C, you’d need to ditch vk-bootstrap and manually handle Vulkan initialization (instance, physical device, logical device, queues, swapchain, etc.), as in your original main.c. This is doable but increases complexity significantly.

Using vk-bootstrap trades pure C purity for simplicity and robustness, requiring only minimal C++ compilation for its parts.

Since your project now works with vk-bootstrap, and you’re okay with this hybrid approach (C for most of your code, C++ for vk-bootstrap), let’s rework main.c to fully utilize it.



What Does vk-bootstrap Do?
vk-bootstrap is a Vulkan initialization library that abstracts away the tedious and error-prone setup steps required to get a Vulkan application running. Here’s what it does in detail:
Instance Creation:
Handles VkInstance creation, including extension management (e.g., VK_KHR_surface, platform-specific extensions like VK_KHR_win32_surface) and optional validation layers.

Simplifies what you’d otherwise do manually with vkCreateInstance.

Physical Device Selection:
Automatically selects a suitable VkPhysicalDevice (GPU) based on criteria like Vulkan version support and surface compatibility (e.g., for presentation), avoiding manual enumeration with vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.

Logical Device and Queue Setup:
Creates a VkDevice and retrieves queues (e.g., graphics, presentation) without requiring you to manually query queue families via vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties and configure VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo.

Swapchain Creation:
Sets up a VkSwapchainKHR with specified parameters (format, extent, present mode), managing the complexities of vkCreateSwapchainKHR and image retrieval.

Error Handling:
Uses a Result type (similar to Rust’s Result) to return success or failure with detailed error messages, making debugging easier than raw Vulkan VkResult checks.

In Short: vk-bootstrap reduces hundreds of lines of manual Vulkan boilerplate into a few function calls, ensuring a robust setup with minimal effort. It’s why your build succeeded once integrated—it avoided the pitfalls my manual C++ changes introduced.

Recommended Libraries for Vulkan and SDL3
Here are some libraries that can streamline development, improve functionality, or add features to your Vulkan and SDL3 project:
1. GLFW (Alternative to SDL3 for Windowing/Input)
Purpose: While you’re using SDL3, GLFW is another lightweight library for window creation, input handling, and OpenGL/Vulkan context management. It’s worth considering if you want a simpler alternative or different input handling.

Why: Offers a minimal API, good Vulkan integration, and is widely used in Vulkan tutorials.

Integration: Replace SDL3 with GLFW in CMakeLists.txt and adjust window/surface creation in vulkan_init.cpp. However, SDL3 already covers this well, so this is optional unless you prefer GLFW’s style.

C Compatibility: Pure C API, fits your approach.

2. Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)
Purpose: Simplifies Vulkan memory management (e.g., vkAllocateMemory, vkBindBufferMemory).

Why: Your current code manually handles memory allocation, which works but is error-prone and verbose. VMA abstracts this, reducing boilerplate and potential bugs (e.g., memory type selection).

Integration: 
Add to CMakeLists.txt with FetchContent:
cmake

FetchContent_Declare(
    vma
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator.git
    GIT_TAG v3.0.1
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(vma)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${vma_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

Include <vk_mem_alloc.h> in a C++ wrapper (e.g., extend vulkan_init.cpp), initialize a VmaAllocator, and use it in create_triangle()/ create_cube() instead of manual allocation.

C Compatibility: C API, so you can wrap it in a C++ file and call from C via extern "C".

3. Dear ImGui (UI Library)
Purpose: Adds a simple, immediate-mode GUI for debugging, settings, or in-game menus.

Why: Useful for displaying stats (e.g., FPS, camera position) or adding interactive controls without building a custom UI system.

Integration:
Fetch via CMakeLists.txt:
cmake

FetchContent_Declare(
    imgui
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git
    GIT_TAG v1.91.0
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(imgui)
target_sources(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE 
    ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR}/imgui.cpp
    ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR}/imgui_draw.cpp
    ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR}/imgui_widgets.cpp
    ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR}/imgui_tables.cpp
    ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR}/backends/imgui_impl_sdl3.cpp
    ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR}/backends/imgui_impl_vulkan.cpp
)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR} ${imgui_SOURCE_DIR}/backends)

Create a C++ wrapper (e.g., imgui_wrapper.cpp) to initialize ImGui with Vulkan and SDL3, and call it from main.c via extern "C".

Add ImGui rendering to your render loop after vkCmdEndRenderPass.

C Compatibility: C++ library, but you can isolate it in a wrapper, keeping main.c pure C.

4. stb Libraries (Image Loading, Fonts, etc.)
Purpose: Single-header libraries for loading images (e.g., textures), fonts, or other data.

Why: If you want to add textures to your triangle/cube, stb_image.h is a lightweight solution for loading PNG/JPG files into Vulkan textures.

Integration:
Download stb_image.h from https://github.com/nothings/stb and place it in your src/ directory.

Include directly in main.c:
c

#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_image.h"

Use to load image data, then create a Vulkan texture (requires additional Vulkan setup: image, image view, sampler).

C Compatibility: Pure C, no wrappers needed.

5. GLM (Math Library)
Purpose: OpenGL Mathematics library for vector/matrix operations.

Why: You’re already using cglm (a C version of GLM), which is perfect for your pure-C goal. No need to switch unless you prefer GLM’s C++ features (e.g., operator overloading).

Integration: Stick with cglm as-is; it’s already integrated and sufficient.

6. SPIRV-Cross (Shader Reflection)
Purpose: Parses SPIR-V shaders to extract metadata (e.g., uniform locations).

Why: Useful if you want to dynamically query shader inputs/outputs instead of hardcoding them (e.g., in create_pipeline()).

Integration:
Fetch via CMakeLists.txt:
cmake

FetchContent_Declare(
    spirv_cross
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross.git
    GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(spirv_cross)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE spirv-cross-c)

Use in a C++ wrapper to parse vert.spv/frag.spv and pass data to main.c.

C Compatibility: Has a C API (spirv-cross-c), so it fits your approach with minimal wrapping.
