Pros and Cons of SPIRV-Cross Libraries
Pros
Cross-Platform Shader Reflection:
SPIRV-Cross excels at parsing SPIR-V (Vulkan’s intermediate representation) and reflecting shader resources (inputs, outputs, uniforms) across multiple backends (GLSL, HLSL, MSL). This was critical for your vertex input reflection.

C API Availability:
The C API (spirv_cross_c.h) allows integration into C-based projects like yours, avoiding C++ dependencies if desired, though it requires careful alignment with its specific function set.

Flexibility:
Supports multiple shader languages, making it versatile for projects targeting different platforms (e.g., Vulkan GLSL here, but could extend to Metal or DirectX).

Open-Source and Active Development:
Maintained by Khronos, with frequent updates (e.g., vulkan-sdk-1.4.304.1 from January 2025). You can build from source to match your Vulkan SDK or project needs.

Integration with Vulkan SDK:
Prebuilt libraries are included in the Vulkan SDK, though we opted for source builds to avoid Debug/Release mismatches.

Cons
API Naming Confusion:
The C API (spvc_*) deviates from the C++ API (get_*), leading to the initial mismatch in your code. This lack of symmetry can trip up developers transitioning between the two or referencing C++ examples.

Build Complexity:
As seen, integrating SPIRV-Cross via CMake required careful handling of Debug/Release library names (-d suffix) and paths. FetchContent simplifies fetching, but linking the right targets/files isn’t always intuitive.

Documentation Gaps:
The C API’s documentation is sparse in spirv_cross_c.h, pushing users to the C++ API docs or source code for clarity, which delayed identifying the correct functions.

Overhead for Simple Use Cases:
For basic reflection (e.g., just vertex inputs), SPIRV-Cross might be overkill compared to lighter alternatives or manual SPIR-V parsing, though it’s justified for broader shader analysis.

Debug/Release Mismatches:
Prebuilt SDK libraries (e.g., spirv-cross-c.lib) are Release-only, causing runtime mismatches (MD vs. MDd) in Debug builds. Building from source mitigated this but added complexity.
