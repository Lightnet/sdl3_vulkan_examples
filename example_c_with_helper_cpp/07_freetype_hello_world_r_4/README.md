# Notes:
 * Improvements Included:
  *  Split into functions like init_app(), run_loop(), cleanup_app() for readability and maintainability.
  * Error handling with cleanup_vulkan_resources on failure.
  * Dynamic window sizing with SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE and recreate_swapchain (placeholder—needs vulkan_init.cpp updates).
  * Shader loading robustness in create_pipeline (assumed earlier).
  * Frame-rate-independent rotation in run_loop.
  * Text caching in create_text (assumed earlier).
  * Modularized loop with run_loop.
  * Swapchain Recreation: The recreate_swapchain function is a placeholder. For it to work fully, you’d need to modify vulkan_init.cpp to accept dynamic width/height parameters, which I can help with separately if desired.
